# Stage Contracts

| Stage | Owner and responsibility | Inputs | Outputs | Paths | Must not do |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Stage0 | `workflow/tools/stage0/main.mjs`; interval gate, backend readiness, ordered execution and final report | CLI/env/runtime config | orchestrator report and stage outcomes | Desktop, Web | Duplicate stage business logic or manually stitch child scripts |
| Stage1 | `workflow/tools/stage1/main.mjs`; retrieval/import boundary, normalization, identity dedupe, feedback learning, rule/LLM grading and audit artifacts | source config or injected Local candidates, previous feedback, standards | `triaged_items.json`, `writeback_ready_items.json`, `preference_learning_audit.json`, run report data | All three | Perform Zotero mutation; expand candidates from semantic neighbors |
| Stage2 | `workflow/tools/stage2/main.mjs`; guarded Zotero create, exact dedupe, collection routing, recovery and shared-index refresh | current-run admitted items and selected backend | `zotero_writeback_summary.json`, exact created keys and routing audit | Desktop, Web only | Run in Local; add new items to root `文献池`; mutate outside guard scope |
| Stage3 | `workflow/tools/stage3/main.mjs`; consume shared title translations, write and verify Zotero `shortTitle`, bounded pool scan | Stage2-admitted items/recent allowed scan candidates, shared translation cache | `abc_translation_backfill.json`, metadata verification | Desktop, Web only | Run in Local; become a second translation generator/cache; write outside admitted/scan scope |
| Stage4 | `workflow/tools/stage4/main.mjs` and export steps; map current results to user-facing workbook/monthly output and export audit | current-run sources, preference audit, Stage2/3 outcome as applicable | `周报.xlsx`, optional `月报-*.docx`, export audit/run summary | All three | Fetch literature, mutate Zotero, or infer historical attachments |
| Stage5 | `workflow/tools/stage5/main.mjs`; format Run Summary, generate/cache title overview, validate current-run attachments, send SMTP and persist receipt | Run Summary, current-run literature titles, recipient, run state root | notification result, `stage5/email_receipt.json`, `stage5/literature_overview.json` | All three after Stage4 | Import Zotero, scan history for attachments, expose secrets, or roll back prior stages |

## Cross-stage gates

- Desktop/Web Stage2 requires successful current-run Stage1 artifacts and backend readiness.
- Stage3 requires a successful/current Stage2 summary. Stage4 requires the configured Stage3 completion semantics.
- Local calls real Stage1 with `skipZotero: true`, then shared translation generation, then Stage4; its Zotero boundary counters must remain zero.
- Stage5 is outside Stage1-Stage4 rollback semantics. No recipient is `skipped`; a configured recipient with invalid SMTP is an explicit notification failure.

## Minimum regression category

- Stage1 semantics: Stage1 artifact, dedupe, grading, and preference-learning tests closest to the change.
- Stage2/3 semantics: backend contract plus Desktop and Web adapter tests; use real benchmarks only with explicit authorization.
- Stage4 mapping: export-source/spreadsheet adapter tests and the path integration using it.
- Stage5: notification, overview, run-state, Run Summary, and relevant entry integration tests with mocks.
- Cross-path shared changes: Desktop/Web integration plus Local poison-boundary tests.
